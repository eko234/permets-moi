# PERMETS-MOI

this little program just sets the default permissions for files and directories recursively
so you might want to run it as sudo if you really got your permissions messed up, you will
need the hare lang compiler for it to work, it's not that hard, then just build or run it like
so: `hare run <path to the main file> <dir in which you want to operate recursively>`
